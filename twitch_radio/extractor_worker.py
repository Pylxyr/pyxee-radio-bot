"""Child process for out-of-process yt-dlp extraction.

Run as ``python -m twitch_radio.extractor_worker`` by
extraction.ProcessBackend; never imported by the bot itself. Speaks
newline-delimited JSON over stdin/stdout, one request per line, one
response per line, strictly in order (a worker handles one request at a
time — the pool provides concurrency by running several of these).

    -> {"id": 7, "query": "ytsearch1:...", "options": {...}}
    <- {"id": 7, "ok": true,  "info": {...}}
    <- {"id": 7, "ok": false, "kind": "download", "error": "..."}

Why a long-lived process rather than one per extraction: importing yt_dlp
pulls in its entire extractor registry and costs the best part of a second,
and YoutubeDL caches the solved YouTube signature challenge on the
extractor instance, which a fresh process would throw away every time. So
the process is reused, and `options` is hashed to key a YoutubeDL instance
per distinct configuration (the fast/fallback attempts in extraction.py
differ in player_client and js_runtimes, and the radio-mix lookup differs
again) — the same trick the thread backend plays with threading.local,
except a hung one here can actually be killed.

Three things this file has to get right because the parent can't fix them:

1. stdout is the protocol channel and nothing else may touch it. yt-dlp
   writes to sys.stdout directly on several paths regardless of `quiet`,
   and a single stray line of progress output would desynchronise the
   framing for the rest of the process's life. sys.stdout is therefore
   redirected to stderr immediately on startup and the real handle is kept
   private to _respond().

2. Responses are projected down to the handful of fields the resolver
   actually reads. A full YouTube info dict is megabytes of format
   listings; serialising that through a pipe on every resolve would cost
   more than it saves.

3. A failure has to come back as a response, not a traceback on stderr —
   the parent is waiting on a line for this request id and would otherwise
   sit there until its timeout fires.
