class JsonStore:
    """Tiny atomic JSON key-value file, guarded by an in-process asyncio.Lock.

    Reads/writes are serialized by the lock (this data is only ever touched
    from the chat bot's commands and the /settings HTTP handler, both on the
    same event loop), and writes are write-temp-then-rename so a crash
    mid-write can never leave a corrupt or half-written file behind.

    Reads are served from an in-memory copy, revalidated against the file's
    (mtime_ns, size) on every call. That matters because the hottest caller
    is the per-chat-message filter check in chatbot.py: without this, every
    single chat message cost a lock acquisition, a thread-pool dispatch, an
    open(), and a json.load() to answer "are the filters on?", which is
    almost always the same two booleans as the message before it. A stat()
    is cheap enough to do inline on the event loop and — unlike a plain
    time-based cache — keeps a hand-edited tunables.json/blocklist.json
    taking effect immediately, which several other modules' error handling
    explicitly assumes is possible.
